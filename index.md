In this workshop I will try to give a few reasons why we might want to consider making music in the browser and - as a consequence of that - generative music. I will try to give some perspective on how we can fit this into the broader context of modern art & media theory history. I will also give some personal insights into how these concepts influenced me as a composer.

There are also code examples on how can incorporate computational thinking into our composition process.
