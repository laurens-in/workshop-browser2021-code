# The Browser, Genrative Music & A Bit Of Perspective

In this workshop I will try to give a few reasons why we might want to consider making music in the browser and - as a consequence of that - generative music. I will try to give some perspective on how we can fit this into the broader context of modern art & media theory history. I will also give some personal insights into how these concepts influenced me as a composer.

I will make a distinction here between algorithmic composition and generative music. In the context of this text I will use the term algorithmic composition to describe music that is merely composed by a computer but does not express itself through a generative system (e.g. the Illiac Suite).

I will use the term generative music to describe music that is not only generated and composed by a computer but also only exists within a generative system (e.g. Live Eternal).

## Part 1 - McLuhan

Lets start with looking at the most infamous quote in modern media theory:

> The medium is the message.

\- Marshall McLuhan
{: .caption} 

This quote is the essence of what media theory is about. While McLuhan certainly doesn't think the medium is the **whole** message, he states that the effect of the medium is by far greater than that of its content, which is merely incidental. As he says: The fact that we have the technology of television has a tremendous effect on the world, how we communicate and how we ultimately develop as a society and individuals. What we print doesn't matter as much as the printed word. The existence of the telephone affects everyone, what you say on the telephone affects very few people.[^mcluhan] [^mcluhan-podcast]

From this realization that the medium at least shapes the message, we can draw two conclusions for us as artists. 

1. The medium through which we express our art matters. A vinyl record is something different than a digital stream. A book is something different than a movie. Certain things can't be expressed in a book that can in a movie and vice versa.
2. If certain media allows us to express things that others don't, then we can also create new forms of art through new media/technologies. Again this is very obvious: Electronic music can only exist because we have devices that are capable of producing electronic sounds.

If we strive to push art to its boundaries, the engagement with contemporary technology - or refusal thereof - becomes almost a necessity.

This is where media art comes into play. Media art - at least in my understanding of the term - is simply art that reflects its own medium. This reflection offers us insight about the specific medium that is used in some kind of way. If we look at Nam June Paiks **Random Access Music** we can see exactly that. The visitor can move the playback head across the tape in any way, which not only produces new kinds of sounds, but also challenges the convention of how we use tape.

So what is the browser? The browser is an environment which executes code, namely HTML, CSS and JavaScript. If we look at the medium-message relationships of that system, it look something like this:

![medium-message](images/medium-message.svg)

Media and message aren't exactly opposites or mutually exclusive: A medium can always become a message in another context. Think about this example: A score can be a medium in which music is the message. Music then again can be a medium through which we can express emotions or abstract ideas.
{: .caption}

Important to me is especially the relationship between code and music. Not because the browser isn't an interesting environment, but because code is the foundation through which we compose music within that environment. The browser has a great importance in our life. Its the portal through which we access the internet, so much so that for a lot of people its synonymous with the internet. But the layers that the browser adds to our artworks are of political or social nature, not so much compositional. So if code is the medium through which our compositions come into existence, what separates code from any other medium?

The possibility to **generate** music in real-time instead of just playing it back. Of course, the browser is not the only medium that is able to generate music, but it does differ from other technology as we will see in the next chapter.

## Part 2 - Benjamin

To understand the importance of the browser as a medium for generative music, we will look at another great shift in history, where technology changed the way we were able to produce art.

In his famous essay "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" (1935) Walter Benjamin talks about the transition art undergoes by entering media which is mechanically reproducible. One essential part of this process is that the artwork looses its aura:

>Even the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking in one element: its presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it happens to be. This unique existence of the work of art determined the history to which it was subject throughout the time of its existence. [...] One might subsume the eliminated element in the term “aura” and go on to say: that which withers in the age of mechanical reproduction is the aura of the work of art.

\- Walter Benjamin, The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction, Chapter II
{: .caption}

But Benjamin is by no means mourning the loss of the aura. The aura is an expression of distance, authority and authenticity of an artwork. In the age of manual reproduction, the reproduction is essentially a forgery and has no authenticity, because authenticity is outside of the sphere of manual or technical reproduction. Aura seems to be only possible through authenticity.

Distance, no matter how near the work of art is, is also an expression of aura. Since the traditional art work is a unique existence in time and space, this distance also exists in both dimensions. Think about standing in front of the Mona Lisa, no matter how close you can get, you can never touch it and even if you could, would you feel like touching its aura? Also the art is fixed in space, and you have to go there and "meet" it, this establishes also a form of hierarchy. The mechanically reproduced artwork however "meets the beholder half way". The traditional art work is also determined by the history to which it is a subject in the time of its existence. This can too create a distance in time between the art and its beholder.

Through reproduction art now becomes available to the masses. This is important for Benjamin from a Marxist point of view:
----Think about the invention of printing and what it meant for people being able to read the bible.[^printing-bible] Benjamin gives us a hint at what he's going at:

>When Marx undertook his critique of the capitalistic
mode of production, this mode was in its infancy. Marx
directed his efforts in such a way as to give them
prognostic value. He went back to the basic conditions
underlying capitalistic production and through his
presentation showed what could be expected of
capitalism in the future. The result was that one could
expect it not only to exploit the proletariat with
increasing intensity, but ultimately to create conditions
which would make it possible to abolish capitalism itself.

\- Walter Benjamin, The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction, Preface
{: .caption}

For Benjamin mass culture - in a bigger picture - seems to play a role in the creation of these conditions to abolish capitalism. Benjamin writes more about the relationship between politics and art in his epilogue, which I encourage everyone to read, but which is beyond to scope of what we are talking about here. What is important here is that for the first time, mass culture becomes possible through capitalistic means of production, which in term has had a huge influence on the way we not only consume but make art.

I would argue that we are now not only in the age of the digital reproduction of art[^digital-art], but go even further: the age of the digital **generation** of art. While of course the digital reproduction was a significant step, it is outweighed by the conceptual difference between reproduction and generation in general.

But how do we conceptualize generative art?

For me it's the idea of an abstract piece of art which exists only through its specific instantiation, which is unique in time and space. These ideas aren't really new though, they have existed in art for quite some time. Not in the dodecaphonic music of Schönberg and his followers, not in the serialism of Messiaen or the algorithmic composition of Hiller & Issacson. We find it first in early performance art, for example the sound-walks of Max Neuhaus: The composition exists in the form of a route which the composer knows and walks with his audience. Within that route the sounds are certainly predictable, but ultimately - from a compositional perspective - random. In addition to that the performance could only be "reproduced" (in a way that it loses its uniqueness) by means of preservation - a recording, a film - or by means of reenactment - essentially theater - by both of which it is no longer performance art as a result.

Generative music on the other - up until now - exists almost exclusively in an exhibition space. This means I have the go to the museum, sit on an uncomfortable chair or bench and listen to the generative piece for about 10 minutes with people walking in and out only conceptually being able to grasp the extent of the composition, then going home, mostly disappointed. What good is an endless composition if I can only listen to it one time?

So why are we in a new age now? Not when the firs generative compositions started playing in exhibitions or concerts? Why draw the line here?

>For the first time ever, the devices people use to listen to music are also capable of executing Generative Music systems.

\- Alex Bainter
{: .caption}

This quote by artist and developer behind [generative.fm](https://generative.fm) Alex Bainter explains what has changed: for the first time generative art has the possibility move into mass culture. It has that possibility because with the browser, we now have an environment which allows artists to produce and distribute real-time systems relatively easily.

So what does this mean for art? How does it affect the aura, authority and authenticity of the work of art?

I can not answer these questions for you, but I can give some insight on what it means in my own work.

Black metal is essentially a quest to bring authenticity to the reproducible medium. It does so by means of production: Because of our common understanding of the medium they use (e.g. tape, in the early days) we intuitively know that the recording "has not been tampered with" - meaning what we hear is in fact a physical effort and not some kind of technological trickery. Why is this necessary though? Performance art faces similar issues but often just refrains from reproduction? The answer is twofold. First, from a pragmatic point of view, musicians expressed themselves through the only medium they thought was available to them. Second, black metal is characterized by a misanthropic worldview, an antisocial attitude and individualism above all else (although rather superficial), ideas which do not fit well into the - by nature - social context of a concert/performance. Given the fact that many bands refrain from playing live shows, the authenticity which they can achieve within reproducible media seems - at least to their perception - to be a meaningful one.

Black metal is also very anti-technological because from their perspective modern technology is what diminishes authenticity (sounds familiar?). Within the framework of black metal this is certainly true to some extent: By using triggered drum sets and modern production or editing technology the physical effort is no longer present as part of our shared understanding of the medium, but vanishes because of exactly that. This is where generative music comes into play, because our shared understanding of (digital) generative music is not one that is concerned with technological trickery as a substitute for physical effort. There is no physical effort involved which could be harmed in its authenticity by technological forces, which is why - at least in my opinion - the artwork remains authentic. The question remains whether this authenticity is the same kind of authenticity Benjamin is talking about, or if this perception of authenticity has shifted in a way that we can no longer compare the two sentiments.

The last thing I want to talk about concerning this subject is authority, and for this we need a different perspective.



## Part 3 - Adorno & Schaeffer

We have established that the browser is an interesting medium that we can use to create new forms of music, I then argued that this form should be a generative form and given some thoughts about the paradigm change this could mean for the work of art in the age of its digital generatability.

I will take a short moment to give some personal insight into my motivation for generative music and the fundamental problem of post war art that it might solve.

https://titel-kulturmagazin.net/2015/02/16/lyrik-und-barbarei/

>To write a poem after Ausschwitz is barbaric.

\- Theodor W. Adorno, Culture Critique and Society
{: .caption}

This quote is controversial and has been discussed at length by numerous people, which is not what I am going to do here. I want to talk about the reason why Adorno had to say it in the first place. While it is often wrongly interpreted as verdict, this is not actually what it says. It captures the feeling which lots of artists and critics had after the second world war: art has failed us. Art in the sense of the romantic artwork, with all its overwhelmingness and pathos. Art that was abused by the nazis to spread their ideology through manipulation of the recipients emotions. If art has the power to manipulate emotions - which I do believe it has - then this means that the artist has power over the listener. This power can be abused, which is a fundamental problem. To counter this many composers delved deeper and deeper into abstract music. This seemed fine to me at first, but then I read an interview with Pierre Schaeffer, in which he said this:

>"You have to remind musicians of what Dante wrote over the Gates of Hell: Abandon hope all ye who enter here. If you enter, if you want to make music, you must abandon hope," Schaeffer warned. In the interview, Schaeffer also used the term ‘DoReMi' to mean traditional musical tuning, instrumentation, and arrangement. "There's no way out of traditional music," he opined. And, most darkly, Schaeffer told Hodgkinson: "Seeing that no one knew what to do anymore with DoReMi, maybe we had to look outside that. Unfortunately it took me forty years to conclude that nothing is possible outside DoReMi. In other words, I wasted my life."

\- Pierre Schaeffer, Interview with Tim Hodgkinson for ReR[^pierre]
{: .caption}

If we do trust Pierre Schaeffer this paints a rather bleak image. At least it did for me, because I do empathize with his statements. Because if we can't continue with *DoReMi* as Adorno suggests and we can't make anything outside of *DoReMi*, what is there left to do?

The answer for me at least was generative music. With generative music I can move in and out of *DoReMi* as a merely incidental side effect, I can abstract the patterns behind manipulative music and reveal them as the result of a simple set of rules and not profound, overwhelming, human emotion. To come back to Benjamin, I can keep my authenticity and get rid of the authority.
