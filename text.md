I will make a distinction here between algorithmic composition and generative music. In the context of this text I will use the term algorithmic composition to describe music that is merely composed by a computer but does not express itself through a generative system (e.g. the Illiac Suite).

I will use the term generative music to describe music that is not only generated and composed by a computer but also only exists within a generative system (e.g. Live Eternal).

## Medium - Message

Lets start with looking at the most infamous quote in modern media theory:

> The medium is the message.

\- Marshall McLuhan
{: .caption} 

This quote is the essence of what media theory is about. While McLuhan certainly doesn't think the medium is the **whole** message, he states that the effect of the medium is by far greater than that of its content, which is merely incidental. The fact that we have the technology of television has a tremendous effect on the world, how we communicate and how we ultimately develop as a society and individuals. What we print doesn't matter as much as the printed word. The existence of the telephone affects everyone, what you say on the telephone affects very few people.[^mcluhan] [^mcluhan-podcast]

So what McLuhan essentially means is that the medium shapes the message and has influence beyond the content of the message. If we believe this to be true then we have to draw two conclusions about that as artists.

1. The medium through which we express our art matters. A vinyl record is something different than a digital stream. A book is something different than a movie. Certain things can't be expressed in a book that can in a movie and vice versa.
2. If certain media allows us to express things that others don't, then we can also create new forms of art through new media/technologies.This seems very obvious: Electronic music can only exist because we have devices that are capable of producing electronic sounds. What might be not so obvious is what makes the browser as a medium so special and what exactly does it offer? 

This is what **media artists** are concerned with. Media art - at least in my understanding of the term - is simply art that reflects its own medium. This reflection offers us insight about the specific medium that is used in some kind of way. If we look at Nam June Paiks **Random Access Music** we can see exactly that. The visitor can move the playback head across the tape in any way, which not only produces new kinds of sounds, but also challenges the convention of how we use tape.

If we want to approach the browser in the same way, we could first take a look at its medium-message relationships:

![medium-message](images/medium-message.svg)

Media and message aren't exactly opposites or mutually exclusive: A medium can always become a message in another context. Think about this example: A score can be a medium in which music is the message. Music then again can be a medium through which we can express emotions or abstract ideas.
{: .caption}

 We can see three layers: the browser, which is an environment to execute code, which is what produces sound. What this means is that our sound will always be a direct consequence of code, which is why I find this relationship to be especially important. Not because the browser isn't an interesting environment, but because code is the foundation through which we compose music within that environment. The browser has a great importance in our life. Its the portal through which we access the internet, so much so that for a lot of people its synonymous with the internet. But the layers that the browser adds to our artworks are of political or social nature, not directly compositional, and we first need a compositional foundation of what it means to express art through code. So if code is the medium through which our compositions come into existence, what separates code from any other medium?

The possibility to **generate** music in real-time instead of just playing it back. Of course, the browser is not the only medium that is able to generate music, however we will see why the browser still plays an important role for art in general!

## A New Age

To understand the importance of the browser as a medium for generative music, we will look at another great shift in history, where technology changed the way we were able to produce art.

In his famous essay "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" (1935) Walter Benjamin talks about the transition art undergoes by entering media which is mechanically reproducible.

>Even the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking in one element: its presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it happens to be. This unique existence of the work of art determined the history to which it was subject throughout the time of its existence. [...] One might subsume the eliminated element in the term “aura” and go on to say: that which withers in the age of mechanical reproduction is the aura of the work of art.

\- Walter Benjamin[^benjamin-1]
{: .caption}

What seems to happen in this transition, is that the work of art looses its aura. But Benjamin is by no means mourning this loss of the aura. The aura is an expression of distance, authority and authenticity of an artwork. In the age of manual reproduction, the reproduction is essentially a forgery and has no authenticity, because authenticity is outside of the sphere of manual or technical reproduction.

Distance is a result of the unique existence in time and space of the traditional art work and expresses itself in both of these dimensions. The artwork is fixed in space, and you have to go there and "meet" it, this establishes a form of hierarchy. But not only that, think about a traditional artwork in a museum: There is always a distance between the visitors on one side and the artwork on the other side. The mechanically reproduced artwork on the other hand "meets the beholder half way". The traditional art work is also determined by the history to which it is a subject in the time of its existence. This creates a kind of temporal distance between the art and its beholder.

Through reproduction art looses this authenticity, distance and authority and for the first time in history mass culture becomes possible. This is important for Benjamin from a Marxist point of view:

>When Marx undertook his critique of the capitalistic
mode of production, this mode was in its infancy. Marx
directed his efforts in such a way as to give them
prognostic value. He went back to the basic conditions
underlying capitalistic production and through his
presentation showed what could be expected of
capitalism in the future. The result was that one could
expect it not only to exploit the proletariat with
increasing intensity, but ultimately to create conditions
which would make it possible to abolish capitalism itself.

\- Walter Benjamin[^benjamin-2]
{: .caption}

For Benjamin mass culture - in a bigger picture - seems to play a role in the creation of these conditions to abolish capitalism. Benjamin writes more about the relationship between politics and art in his epilogue, which I encourage everyone to read, but which is beyond to scope of what we are talking about here. What is important here is that for the first time, mass culture becomes possible through capitalistic means of production, which in term has had a huge influence on the way we not only consume but make art.

So why is any of this important for us now?

I believe that we are now in a similar situation, the shift of a paradigm. It can be helpful to look at history to draw our own conclusions for the present. I would argue that we are now not only in the age of the digital reproduction of art, but go even further: the age of the digital **generation** of art. While of course the digital reproduction was a significant step, it is outweighed by the conceptual difference between reproduction and generation in general.

First we need to think about how we can conceptualize generative art:

For me it's the idea of an abstract piece of art which exists only through its specific instantiation, which is unique in time and space - to use Benjamins terminology. These ideas aren't really new though, they have existed in art for quite some time. Not in the dodecaphonic music of Schönberg and his followers, not in the serialism of Messiaen or the algorithmic composition of Hiller & Issacson. We find it first in early performance art, for example the sound-walks of Max Neuhaus: The composition exists in the form of a route which the composer knows and walks with his audience. Within that route the sounds are certainly predictable, but ultimately - from a compositional perspective - random. It is interesting to note that reproduction - for the sake of e.g. documentation - is a big topic in performance art. Some argue that performance art could only be "reproduced" in a way that it loses its uniqueness. By means of preservation - a recording, a film - or by means of reenactment - essentially theater - by both of which it is no longer performance art as a result.

So if these ideas have existed that long even before real-time computer-generated music was a thing - which of course it has been for quite a while now - why do I draw the line here and now?

Generative music - up until now - exists almost exclusively in an exhibition space. This usually means I have the go to the museum, sit on an uncomfortable chair or bench and listen to the generative piece for about 10 minutes with people walking in and out only conceptually being able to grasp the extent of the composition, then going home, mostly disappointed (this is essentially how Benjamin described *traditional* art in 1935). What good is an *endless* composition if I can only listen to it one time? This bothered me so much - that there was no generative music that I could listen to in the way I like to enjoy music - that I made live-eternal. Maybe now you start to see where this is going:

>For the first time ever, the devices people use to listen to music are also capable of executing Generative Music systems.

\- Alex Bainter[^bainter]
{: .caption}

This quote by artist and developer behind [generative.fm](https://generative.fm) Alex Bainter explains what has changed: For the first time generative art has the possibility move into mass culture. It has that possibility because we don't just have the devices but with the modern browser, we now have an environment which allows artists to produce and distribute (important) real-time generative systems quite easily. I say quite easily in contrast to what we would need to do if we didn't have a modern browser.

So what does this mean for art? How does it affect the authenticity, distance and authority - and ultimately the aura - of the artwork?

I can not answer these questions for you, but I can give some insight on what it means in my own work.

Black metal is essentially a quest to bring authenticity to the reproducible medium. It does so by means of production: Because of our common understanding of the medium they use (e.g. tape, in the early days) we intuitively know that the recording "has not been tampered with" - meaning what we hear is in fact a physical effort and not some kind of technological trickery. Why is this necessary though? Performance art faces similar issues but often just refrains from reproduction? The answer is twofold. First, from a pragmatic point of view, musicians expressed themselves through the only medium they thought was available to them. Second, black metal is characterized by a misanthropic worldview, an antisocial attitude and individualism above all else (although rather superficial), ideas which do not fit well into the - by nature - social context of a concert/performance. Given the fact that many bands refrain from playing live shows, the authenticity which they can achieve within reproducible media seems - at least to their perception - to be a meaningful one.

Given the fact that many bands refrain from playing live shows, the authenticity which they can achieve within reproducible media seems - at least to their perception - to be a meaningful one. Black metal is also very anti-technological because from their perspective modern technology is what diminishes authenticity (sounds familiar?). Within the framework of black metal this is certainly true to some extent: By using triggered drum sets and modern production or editing technology the physical effort is no longer present as part of our shared understanding of the medium, but vanishes because of exactly that. This is where generative music comes into play, because our shared understanding of (digital) generative music is not one that is concerned with technological trickery as a substitute for physical effort. There is no physical effort involved which could be harmed in its authenticity by technological forces, authenticity is outside the sphere of digital generation (sounds familiar again?). We can see how our perception of authenticity shifted and how those same questions arise again. 

But what about the authority of the generative artwork? To talk about this, we need another perspective.



## Generative Music & Authority

This chapter will be intense, but it is a very important subject to talk about.


>To write a poem after Ausschwitz is barbaric.

\- Theodor W. Adorno, Culture Critique and Society
{: .caption}

https://titel-kulturmagazin.net/2015/02/16/lyrik-und-barbarei/

This is a very strong quote that has been discussed extensively, applied to music, misinterpreted and ultimately even kind of retracted by Adorno. We are not going to discuss whether Adorno or not. I bring this quote up because I think it is almost impossible to talk about western - or more specifically european - modern art without the context of the second world war. I want to clarify that this is a very eurocentric view that I'm discussing here and I don't want to give anyone the impression that we can only look at art through this specific lense, its just where I see **myself** as an artist and how I have been educated. What this quote essentially expresses is a feeling of distrust in art. The term art interpreted as the romantic artwork with all its pathos and overwhelmingness, which has been abused by the nazis for propaganda and manipulation.[^adorno-1] [^adorno-2]

If we agree that art can be used to manipulate emotions - this is done all the time, commercials, movies, etc. - and we have seen where it can lead to - for example fascism, then we have a serious problem as artists. Power in terms creates **authority**. If we as artists have power over the listeners emotions -  this power can be abused by ourselves or others, like the nazis used Beethoven.[^beethoven] Another aspect of this was the question of whether or not art is capable of expressing adequately the horrors of the second world war, if art is able to express genuine emotion at all? This has led to more and more abstract art in the post war era, which was a means for artists to cede some of this power and authority. And this could be it, art has to be abstract, there is no going back. Enter Pierre Schaffer:

>"You have to remind musicians of what Dante wrote over the Gates of Hell: Abandon hope all ye who enter here. If you enter, if you want to make music, you must abandon hope," Schaeffer warned. In the interview, Schaeffer also used the term ‘DoReMi' to mean traditional musical tuning, instrumentation, and arrangement. "There's no way out of traditional music," he opined. And, most darkly, Schaeffer told Hodgkinson: "Seeing that no one knew what to do anymore with DoReMi, maybe we had to look outside that. Unfortunately it took me forty years to conclude that nothing is possible outside DoReMi. In other words, I wasted my life."

\- Pierre Schaeffer[^schaeffer]
{: .caption}

This is of course a statement of opinion - but its an opinion that I can intuitively sympathize with. You don't have to agree with Schaeffer here, but it struck a nerve with me and to be honest I can't fully express why. Maybe because I have been to conditioned to like traditional music? Maybe it is exciting to explore hierarchy, harmony, tonality and modality in music? Maybe refraining from doing so is like speaking a language that no one else speaks. I honestly can't give you an answer, but you can see the fundamental dilemma if you were to accept both of these thoughts - Adornos and Schaeffers. The only way out of this dilemma I found as an artist is generative music. With generative music I can move in and out of *DoReMi* as a merely incidental side effect, I can abstract the patterns behind manipulative music and reveal them as the result of a simple set of rules and not profound, overwhelming, human emotion. Generative music can be a way to give up power and authority. And to come back to why we are all here, the browser can also play a role in that.

## Trust & Free Software

The browser is by design a very open environment. JavaScript is a just-in-time compiled scripting language, which means that essentially because I receive the script and not some obscure binary that just does something on my device. (There is obscured JavaScript but I will not get into that here). This means that we no longer - as is the case in almost all other settings for generative music - need to trust the composer. Because even in the museum setting the composer has total authority - is what I'm hearing really generative music? This comes down to an element of trust that we need to have in the composer, because authority without trust is oppression isn't it? In the browser this kind of black box of the generative system is revealed and even if the code is unreadable or if I can't read code, I at least know that the code is executed on my device, in real time. (This might seem a bit nit-picky but it is conceptually different.) To keep this open environment alive, which gives us tools like e.g. [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/), we should use and produce free software.

But make no mistake, do not confuse free software with open source. Because while the two terms almost describe the same thing in terms of code - most open source code is free software - there is a huge conceptual difference. While open source focuses only on practical aspects and is essentially a capitalistic appropriation of the free software movement, the latter takes an ethical stance about the way we should write and use software.

- The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
- The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1).Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
- The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).
- The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.[^free-software]

>We campaign for these freedoms because everyone deserves them. With these freedoms, the users (both individually and collectively) control the program and what it does for them. When users don’t control the program, we call it a “nonfree” or “proprietary” program. The nonfree program controls the users, and the developer controls the program; this makes the program an instrument of **unjust power**.

GNU Foundation[^free-software]

Proprietary software gives the programmer power over the user. This power can be abused, hence we should reject it. This sounds kind of familiar right? 


I will leave it at this, but i would like to point to a more recent development which is the introduction of ethical software licenses. While a controversial topic within the software world I do think it is an interesting approach and it points to a real and ever growing problem: the *misuse* of free software - like for example in [this case](https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20691957/mastodon-decentralized-social-network-gab-migration-fediverse-app-blocking).
