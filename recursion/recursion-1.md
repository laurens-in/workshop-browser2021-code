# Part 1

Recursion is the simple principle of a process calling itself until a stop condition is met. If the condition is met, all calls will be evaluated recursively

```js
const countBack = x => {
    if (x === 0) break; // simple stop condition
    console.log(x)      // log x to console
    countBack(x-1)      // call the function recursively
}
```
